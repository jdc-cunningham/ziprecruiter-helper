- add general poll that checks if the selected job is open
  - looks for selector: `.zds-scrollbar h2` then verify it's right, it should say "Job description" inside
  - that means the right thing is open, some links are external but this extension won't apply there
- there is a different view if you're looking at search box results, has left sidebar
- or equivalent experience (flag as green)

I'm fresh now and have time but I have low hopes of getting a new job

Either lack of degree, not a senior, tech stack...

But if I don't try my life won't change

I'm looking at this sidebar, I will have to bind to the scrollbar event as a main driver to check the cards

At least the components on this page have nice CSS class names

I actually miss writing code/haven't made anything in a bit just because I work everyday now

I can't really code right now since it's after a workday/I'm tired af

But I added the task above
