- add general poll that checks if the selected job is open
  - looks for selector: `.zds-scrollbar h2` then verify it's right, it should say "Job description" inside
  - that means the right thing is open, some links are external but this extension won't apply there
- there is a different view if you're looking at search box results, has left sidebar
- or equivalent experience (flag as green)
